Hello my name is pranav
 
--------------------------
there are two types we can change permission of files in linux
1)=> first is by using charter symbols 
> 'r' for read 'w' for write 'x' for execute
> there are three types of permission to particular user , group and public 
> with each having 3 type of permission read,write,execute 
> we have to give evry individual so it contains 
 9 fields 3 for each usertype
> first 3 for user , seccond 3 fields for group and last 3 
 fields for public access
> so we give first initials to specify the type of user 
> o=public access/others
> g=group
> u=user
> a=all
ex: 1)we want to give only read permission to user we write cmd as follows and 
2)if we want to give some permission for all we write
1)=> #chmod +r filename 
2)=> #chmod +rwrwrw filename //here we gave only needed permission with combinations of user group and public

Answer 2)
before::
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 24 Feb 20 10:13 abcd.txt
so output::
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# chmod a+rwx abcd.txt 
op::mode of 'abcd.txt' retained as 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)
---------------------------------------------------
now seocnd way is by giving number system for permission
as follows"
here are only 3 fields
first=user/owner
second=group
third=public/other access
number-system is :: 4=read ,2=write ,1=execute
so its combination of 7
if we gave 777 it means all permissions granted
like wise..
---------------------------
Answer 3)
history command is used to get the history of commands
or to search specific command press ctrl + r multiple times or single time and search for command used
 
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# history 
 1 hostname screamy
 2 pwd
 3 su kali
 4 exit
 5 touch abcd.txt
 6 ls
 7 vim abcd.txt
 8 cat abcd.txt
 9 ls -all 
 10 chmod -g +rwx abcd.txt
 11 chmod a+rwx abcd.txt
 22 chmod -v a+rwx abcd.txt
 
-----------------
Answer 4)
to remove directory or folder we use
rm -r path_ordir_name-------------here -r means recursive as a dir can contain multiple files in it
rm-rf path ---------used to delete/ remove dir or file without permission
 
::┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─# rm -vr abcd/bb
removed directory 'abcd/bb'
