Day 4 Task: Basic Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers.
What is Kernel
The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer’s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
What is Shell
A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands
from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from
input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
What is Linux Shell Scripting?
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a linux shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts
are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

Tasks
Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge
Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

Answer 1)=>A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of 
shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program
execution, and printing text.Shell scripting alo can be used to atutomate repeated tasks related to systems and servers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer 2)=>bash and sh are two different shells of the Unix operating system. bash is sh, but with more features and better syntax.
Bash is “Bourne Again SHell”, and is an improvement of the sh (original Bourne shell). Shell scripting is scripting in any shell, 
whereas Bash scripting is scripting specifically for Bash. sh is a shell command-line interpreter of Unix/Unix-like operating systems.
sh provides some built-in commands. bash is a superset of sh. Shell is a command-line interface to run commands and shell scripts. 
Shells come in a variety of flavors, much as operating systems come in a variety of flavors. So, Shell is an interface between the 
user and the operating system, which helps the user to interact with the device.
sh:
#!/bin/sh
bash:
#!/bin/bash
bash:
bash is also a command programming language like sh. Nowadays, bash is a default login shell on most Linux-based operating systems.
It is an extended version of the sh system for GNU replacement for the Bourne shell. We can also say bash is a programming language. 
Here think like python, we can start python in interactive mode and it behaves like a shell but we can also run python program on any IDE.

sh:
sh is also called Bourne Shell. sh is a command programming language described by POSIX standard. It is for UNIX or UNIX-like operating 
systems. It has many implementations. On most operating systems, sh is implemented by programs like dash, kash, and original Bourne Shell. 
sh is a Predecessor of bash. /bin/sh is an actual link to main implementations. It is a symlink in most POSIX systems.

according to this doc, we can write #!bin/sh but it is recommended to use bash as bash is superset of sh

Answer 3)=>A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.

#!bin/bash
echo"I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge "
for output use cmd ./filename.sh

Answer 4)=>#!/bin/bash
# Take user input
echo "Enter a value:"
read user_input
# Access command-line arguments
arg1=$1
arg2=$2
# Print variables
echo "User input: $user_input"
echo "Argument 1: $arg1"
echo "Argument 2: $arg2"

make it executable :: chmod +x filename.sh
for output cmd ===./filename.sh argument1 argument2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer 5)=> #!/bin/bash 
# Assign values to variables 
num1=10 num2=20
 # Compare the numbers 
if [ $num1 -eq $num2 ]; 
then echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"
 elif [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]; 
then echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
 else echo "$num1 is greater than $num2" 
fi
